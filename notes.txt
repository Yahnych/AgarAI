Simulation for the von Mises distribution is generally done via some 
form of rejection sampling. There is no method available to transform 
a random variate from a different distribution to a von Mises random 
variate in the way you describe. A natural way would have been some 
form of inversion sampling, but the CDF of the von Mises distribution 
is not analytic, so this may not be possible.

Two distributions similar to von Mises that may be of interest to you 
are the Wrapped Normal and Wrapped Cauchy distribution. For the Wrapped
Normal, we can simply take 

        𝑋 ∼ 𝑁 (𝜇,𝜎²)

then Θ = 𝑋 [mod 2𝜋] to have 𝜃 ∼ 𝑊 𝑁 (𝜇,𝜌), where 𝜌 = exp(−𝜎²/2).
For the Wrapped Cauchy with parameters 𝜇 and 𝜌, get a random variate 𝑢 
from Uniform(0,2𝜋), then

        𝑉 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑢)
        𝑐 = 2𝜌 / (1 + 𝜌²)
        𝜃 = acos((𝑉 + 𝑐)/ (1 + 𝑐𝑉)) + 𝜇  [mod 2𝜋].

Then 𝜃 ∼ 𝑊 𝐶 (𝜇,𝜌). This procedure is due to Fisher (1995).
